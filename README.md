# Stroke Risk Analysis and Prediction: A Data-Driven Machine Learning Approach

  This project presents a comprehensive analysis and prediction of stroke risk based on demographic and health-related attributes. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling using multiple classification algorithms.


## 1. Project Overview
   
   The primary objective of this project is to identify patterns and build machine learning models that can predict the likelihood of a stroke in individuals based on various health and lifestyle factors.

## 4. Project Workflow

### 4.1 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

    Handled missing values and outliers
    Performed encoding of categorical variables
    Normalized numerical features


### 4.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Univariate analysis (histograms, bar plots)
    Bivariate analysis (boxplots, violin plots)
    Correlation matrices (Pearson and Spearman)
    Subgroup analysis by age, gender, and residence
    Multivariate interaction analysis and Chi-square tests


### 4.3 Feature Engineering

     Selected relevant predictors based on correlation and domain logic
     Checked multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)


### 4.4 Modeling

    1. Linear Regression
    2. Logistic Regression
    3. Decision Tree
    4. Random Forest
    5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


## 5. Results and Insights
   
    Best Accuracy Achieved: ~95%

    Key Predictors Identified:
    	Age
	    Hypertension
	    Heart Disease
      Average Glucose Level
    	BMI
		 
    The model successfully distinguishes stroke-prone individuals, especially with significant health conditions.
